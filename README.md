# Deep Learning Challenges
This is the repo for the challenges of the **Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning** course at Polytechnic University of Milan, 2020/2021.

There are 3 kaggle competitions based on 3 different tasks that cover the most important topics learned during the course. We decided to use *Google Colab* to exploit the powerful GPU offered by *Google*. The main library used for building the neural network architectures is *TensorFlow* as explained throughout the course.

## Challenges ##

### Image Classification  ###

The goal of the challenge is to classify images of people wearing masks ( thanks Covid-19 ). The different labels are described below.
* All the people in the image are wearing a mask 
* No person in the image is wearing a mask
* Someone in the image is not wearing a mask.
